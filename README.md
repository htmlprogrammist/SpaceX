[Link to the technical specification in Notion](https://htmlprogrammist.notion.site/Task-11-RSS-1acee8c171a04ea98e6935dac9d97172)

In this project, I demonstrated the knowledge of:
1. UIKit
2. Networking, URLSession
3. Multithreading/Concurrency
4. Animations
6. MapKit, WebKit
7. Unit tests

There are not many screens, but there are quite a large number of different small interface elements on each, each of which has its own joke.

# Requirements
- Minimum version: iOS 12.1
- The use of third-party (not from the standard SDK) libraries is prohibited
- The use of Storyboard is prohibited
- Swift programming language
- UIKit is used to implement the interface
